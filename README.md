# Ledger

## Proposal

**Ledger** is a Java desktop application that offers users with simple and smart ways to keep track of income and 
expense items. The application includes some basic features that allow users to edit and review a list of budget items 
with related information, such as date, category, payer or payee, description and amount, anywhere and anytime with 
their laptop. The application also includes other features that helps users to become financial well-being. Users can 
generate a summary of their savings and spending, such as the percentage of expenses under different categories and the 
changes of financial condition over time to better plan their budget. Users can search and filter specific items with 
certain criteria as well. Anyone who wants to be well-organized and well-planned financially will use the application. 
Students, professionals, housewives, etc. might find it useful.

This project is of interest to me because financial data is of great importance for individuals and companies. People 
can live a better life and companies can become more successful if they plan better in finance. I have studied 
accounting for a few years and have knowledge and understanding of financial concepts.
